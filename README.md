# Eat-Da-Burger-
Demonstration of MVC paradigm, facilitated using express, MySQL, Handlebars and Node.js

<hr>

<h1>Application Description</h1>
  
  <p> This app allows you to create named burgers, and then eat them. This demonstrates interaction with a database, 
specifically CRU functions on a server and affecting HTML using express, MySQL, and Handlebars.</p>

<h1> Application Demonstration </h1>

<h4> We can see here that the buttons and form add and change the boolean values in the database. </h4>

<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>

<p>I could not deploy to heroku. I encounter the following error repeatedly when trying to connect the SQL database to the 
JAWSDB. My ports are consistent, I'm certain there are no stray spaces, I'm certain these are the correct fields. I really 
have no idea what the issue could be. 
@ 12:15
I went to test the connection to show the error I received and it worked perfectly fine... I'll finish deploying anyway and 
hopefully that's worth credit. I have a working app demonstration from before this point on a localhost. </p>

<h2> Future Directions </h2>

<h4> Options for this app are fairly limited as far as future directions. With Heroku deployment there isn't much more to add 
  besides unnecessary complexity. In theory "ingredients" could be added to each burger, and a delete function could be 
  implemented as well. </h4>
